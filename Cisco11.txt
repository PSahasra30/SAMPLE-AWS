EXPERIMENT BASIC FIREWALL CONFIGURATION:

Manual Firewall Configuration (Inbound Rule):
This part explains how to manually block a specific IP using the Windows Firewall GUI.
Steps:
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
2. Click on Inbound Rules.
3. Click New Rule,on the right panel.
4. Select Custom and click Next.
5. Choose All Programs → Click Next.
6. Protocol and Ports: Keep default → Click Next.
7. Scope:
o Under Remote IP address, select These IP addresses.
o Click Add and enter the IP you want to block (example: 1.2.3.4).
o Click OK → Next.
8. Action: Select Block the connection → Next.
9. Profile: Select Domain, Private, Public → Next.
10. Name the rule (example: Manual_Block_IP) → Finish.
This rule will now block all incoming traffic from that specific IP

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that downloads a list of malicious IP addresses from a trusted online
source and automatically creates firewall rules to block those IPs from accessing the system.

firewall.py:

import requests, csv, subprocess

# source: Abuse CH
response = requests.get(
"https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/ipblocklist.csv"
).text

# Delete previous rule (if exists)
rule = 'netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="BadIP"'
subprocess.run(["PowerShell", "-Command", rule])

mycsv = csv.reader(
filter(lambda x: not x.startswith("#"), response.splitlines())
)

for row in mycsv:
    ip = row[1]
    if ip != "dst_ip":
        print("Added Rule to block:", ip)
        rule = "netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name='BadIP' Dir=Out Action=Block RemoteIP=" + ip
        subprocess.run(["PowerShell", "-Command", rule])








EXPERIMENT PASSWORD STRENGTH TESTING USING PYTHON:

password.py:

import re

def check_password_strength(password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return "Weak: Password must be at least 8 characters long."

    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        return "Weak: Password must include at least one number."

    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):
        return "Weak: Password must include at least one uppercase letter."

    if not any(char.islower() for char in password):
        return "Weak: Password must include at least one lowercase letter."

    if not re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password):
        return "Medium: Add special characters to make your password stronger."

    return "Strong: Your password is secure!"


def password_checker():
    print("Welcome to the Password Strength Checker!")
    
    while True:
        password = input("\nEnter your password (or type 'exit' to quit): ")

        if password.lower() == "exit":
            print("Thank you for using the Password Strength Checker! Goodbye!")
            break

        result = check_password_strength(password)
        print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    password_checker()












EXPERIMENT PACKET SNIFFING AND NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS:

python3 -m http.server 8080

Step 4: In another new terminal start packet capture:
sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap port 8080

Step 5: Open Firefox in kali Linux and go to:
http://localhost:8080
Refresh the page to generate traffic

Step 6:
Go back to tcpdump terminal.
Stop packet capturing by using Ctrl + C.
It will stop and show how many packets were captured
The packets are saved as capture.pcap.

Step 7:
• Click the Kali Linux dragon icon (top left).
• Type: File Manager and open it.
• Your Home folder will open.
• You will see the file: capture.pcap.
just double-click capture.pcap.The file will open directly in Wireshark for analysis

Step 9:-
Filter Login Packets
In Wireshark filter bar, type: http.request.method == "GET"
Press Enter.
Now only important packets will show

Step 10:-
Click on any one of the packet and the following data is displayed.
Browser details such as OS, browser version, language, and visited URLs are visible.If a form is
submitted, username and password can be seen in plain text.This proves HTTP is insecure.

Conclusion :-
Packets were successfully captured and analyzed. Sensitive data is visible when HTTP is
used.Packet sniffing and network traffic analysis show that unencrypted communication is unsafe.
HTTPS is necessary to protect data.

Step 1: Open Brute Force Module
Navigate to:
DVWA → Vulnerabilities → Brute Force

Step 2: Try Common Passwords
Enter:
Username: admin
Password: password

Experiment 2: Manual Brute Force Attack
Enter Username (Same Every Time)
In Username field, type:
admin
Do NOT change username.
Step 3: Try Passwords ONE BY ONE
Now you will manually try passwords (this is the “manual brute force”).
Attempt 1
 Username: admin
 Password: admin
 Click Login
If it fails → try next password
Attempt 2
 Username: admin
 Password: 123456
 Click Login
If it fails → try next password
Attempt 3
 Username: admin
 Password: password
 Click Login
Step 4: Observe What Happened
 DVWA did NOT block you
 DVWA did NOT lock account
 DVWA allowed unlimited attempts
This is called Brute Force Vulnerability
